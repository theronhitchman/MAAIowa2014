## Building Toward Student Ownership

These are slides for my address to the Fall 2014 meeting of the Iowa Section of
the Mathematical Association for America. This is my valedictory, having been
awarded the section's Teaching Award in fall 2013.

The talk is held at Clarke University in Dubuque, IA on 25 October, 2014.

The main idea here is to blend a bit of my personal story, a little demonstration,
and some discussion of the main idea behind IBL teaching.

These slides are built as a reveal.js slide deck.
